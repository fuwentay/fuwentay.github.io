            Whether you believe equity prices follow a random walk, one thing is certain: financial markets are fundamentally driven by supply and demand.
        </p>
        <p>
            Suppose the bid-ask is $100/$101. 
            Only when the buyer is willing to pay $101 will the trade be filled.
            Similarly, only when the seller is willing to sell at $100 will the trade be filled.
            That is because the buyer and seller have to agree upon the same price -- the filled price.
        </p>
        <p>
            So why would a buyer suddenly be willing to pay a higher price above the bid?
        </p>
        <p>
            It is due to their expectation that the price will rise after gaining new information. 
            If enough buyers share this expectation, they will bid up the price, clearing out the lower-priced sellers and causing the price to rise. 
            Inversely, if sellers expect the price to fall, they will sell aggressively, clearing out higher-priced buyers and driving the price lower.
        </p>
        <p>
            As such, analysing order flow is often used to predict short-term price movements. 
            (Order flow represents the volume and direction of buy and sell orders in the market. It is an indicator of supply and demand, as it reveals the intensity and behaviour of market participants.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Initially, I viewed technical analysis as a sham. 
            But if enough market participants believe in it, it becomes a reality. 
            For instance, when traders identify regions of support based on aligning peaks or troughs, they collectively create buying pressure near that price. 
            This surge in demand clears out lower-priced sellers, causing the price to rise. 
            Similarly, traders selling at resistance levels create supply pressure, which clears out higher-priced buyers, driving the price lower. 
            This makes technical levels somewhat of a self-fulfilling prophecy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then when does the trading price ever break beyond the support or resistance?
        </p>
        <p>
            The trading price breaks beyond support or resistance levels when a catalyst shifts the balance of supply and demand. 
            For example, the release of U.S. economic reports, announcements of interest rate changes, or stock splits can act as catalysts. 
            A bullish catalyst might cause demand to surge, overwhelming the selling pressure at a resistance level and pushing the price higher. 
            Inversely, a bearish catalyst can increase supply, overwhelming buying pressure at a support level and driving the price lower.
