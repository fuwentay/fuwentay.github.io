        <h3>Why should you trust me?</h3>
        I have nothing to gain and I am just trying to educate others.</p>

        <p>Initially, I was toying with the idea of timing pump & dumps (P&Ds). However, through my research, I have concluded that it is not possible to time the pump or dump. Hence, there are astronomical risks associated with riding the P&D.</p>

        <p>As such, I have decided to devote some time to prevent others from getting scammed.</p>

        <h3>What is a Pump & Dump?</h3>
        <p>A pump & dump is a synthetically induced rally and fall of the price of an asset (stock, crypto, etc.).</p>

        <h3>How is a Pump Organised?</h3>
        <p>Large buying volume can clear all the low sell orders, pushing up the price of the stock. This effect is even more pronounced in low-liquidity assets, where the order book is thin and price movements are exaggerated. The trading price you see in such cases is often not a fair representation of value, as it can be artificially inflated by market manipulation. This is especially true for stocks or cryptocurrencies that have gone through multiple cycles of Pump & Dumps, where syndicates influence traders to buy and hold the asset, creating an illusion of demand.</p>

        <h3>How does a Dump Happen?</h3>
        <p>A dump happens when there is suddenly high selling volume that clears all the high buy orders, driving the price of the stock down to oblivion.</p>

        <h3>Think You Can Profit from a Pump? Think Again.</h3>
        <p>If you are trying to ride the pump of a stock by longing it, I strongly advise against it. Syndicates load up heavily on positions before organizing a pump, and by the time you hear about it, the stock may have already gone through multiple rounds of pumping, making it at high risk of a dump.</p>

        <h3>Think You Can Profit from a Dump? Think Again.</h3>
        <p>If you are trying to ride the dump of a stock by shorting it, I also strongly advise against it. Shorting requires paying an extremely high fee to borrow the stock due to its limited availability. These stocks are often highly shorted, meaning there aren't many shortable shares left. Additionally, syndicates can push prices even higher before dumping, resulting in massive losses for you. They can also sustain pumps for prolonged periods—draining your account due to high borrow costs associated with shorting.</p>

        <h3>Can You Even Time It?</h3>
        <p>As someone else put it, "they are crooks, not stupid." They don’t have to follow the same rulebook and can change their behavior at any moment. You will not be able to time the peak due to its synthetic nature. Unlike a typical market bubble that gradually shifts before bursting—where you could quantitatively model its behavior—pump and dumps are violent and sudden.</p>

        <h3>"I Have Made Profits in the Past, So I Will Make More in the Future"</h3>
        <p>This is merely wishful thinking. I dare to say that the expected value of participating in a P&D is negative. You may have short-term gains, but over the long run, you will likely face net losses. It is equivalent to—or worse than—gambling in a casino.</p>

        <h3>Hallmarks of a P&D</h3>
        <p>To maintain control over trading prices, these syndicates typically target low market-cap stocks. Many of these stocks originate from China or Hong Kong and are listed on NASDAQ (and possibly other exchanges).</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>There are profits to be made in the markets through long-term investing in companies with solid fundamentals.</p>

        <p><strong>Stay clear of P&Ds. Greed kills.</strong></p>
