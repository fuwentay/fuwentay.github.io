            Signals in the context of trading refer to information that may lead you to a long/short decision.
            It could be the recently announced increase in <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm">Consumer Price Index (CPI)</a> 
            or when the 100-day Moving Average of an equity crosses above the 30-day Moving Average.
        </p>

            However, oftentimes one would see "Trading Gurus" sell signals (usually for currency pairs) that directly tell you what to buy and when to buy. For example,
            <b>"Buy AUD/CHF @ 0.5710, Take Profit @ 0.5840, Stop Loss @ 0.5550"</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Does it make sense to sell signals? If we can show that sharing signals would reduce alpha, it means that this business of selling signals would
            hurt the "gurus" potential profits that could have been gained by leveraging his trades. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If the guru genuinely believes that his signal is profitable, he would long AUD/CHF before he shares the signal &mdash; gaining the first-mover advantage. 
            Followers of the signal would simply pump AUD/CHF as they buy @0.5710 and at higher prices due to the fear of missing out. Any time after the price 
            has gone up, the guru can offload his positions dumping AUD/CHF. And even if he doesn't, the selling pressure near 0.5840 may cause the currency pair to 
            dip before the take profit. Therefore, it may not be advantageous to be a follower of a signal.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course on a small-scale this does not happen due to the large volume of currency pairs being traded daily. But once it is an equity or crypto with 
            low trading volume and low market cap, it is possible to swing the price with sufficient volume by clearing out the top of the order book &mdash; 
            as explained <a href="journal.html#equity-price-movements">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nonetheless, you can see why sharing signals would diminish alpha. Following signals sets you up to be like a <a href="journal.html#pump-and-dump">Pump and Dump</a> 
            victim where you create the "exit liquidity".
        </p>
        <p>
            Suppose the guru is well intentioned, and let's take on a contrarian point of view. He could be simply hedging his portfolio by reducing his order size and
            profiting from selling his signals alongside. After all, there is a limit to how much one can leverage his positions before he thins the order book &mdash;
            filling at non-ideal prices.
        </p>
        <p>
            With all that said, I am a skeptic and I believe that almost all trading gurus are scammers.
        </p>

            If you share the same thoughts as me and would like to understand why "retail forex" trading is likely to be a scam, <a href="../reddit_reads.html#trading-gurus">this</a> explains it well.
