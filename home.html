            </p>
            <p id="lineBreak">
                I'm Fu, currently studying Engineering Science @ Oxford. <br><br>
                I enjoy reading books about Finance and working on my own personal projects.

                <h2>My journey</h2>
            </p>
            <p id="lineBreak">
                Since I was in high school, I have always loved math and physics &mdash; regularly participating in the Olympiads, and any math or 
                science-related workshops. <br><br>

                Although I already had an interest, participating in the Singapore Young Physicist Tournament was what spurred it further. 
                It was a scientific debate competition where students had to hypothesise the explanation to a phenomenon, come up with a theoretical 
                model, and validate it, while fighting off criticism from other teams. Participating in 2 iterations of the competition, I investigated 
                problems such as the paradoxical sinking motion of bubbles in a column of oscillating fluid, and the motion of a real Newton&apos;s cradle 
                with Hertzian losses to name a few. <br><br>

                Through this, I developed a deep interest in research and aspired to be an applied researcher at the Agency for Science, Technology and 
                Research (A*STAR) &mdash; where I ended up interning at for almost 2 years, building a smart mattress to alleviate pressure ulcer formation 
                (that has been patented under the agency). <br><br>

                However, as I did more hardware and firmware internships, I realised that I preferred to work on software-related projects. Because I found 
                hardware to have too many degrees of freedom and in turn more room for error, whereas I enjoyed building the logic &mdash; the "brain" of the 
                system. <br><br>

                Through the Covid-19 pandemic, information regarding investing and trading become more accessible and public as there was an insurgence 
                of trading gurus and financial advisors online. That was when I created my first expert advisor on MetaTrader4 using moving average crossovers 
                and the relative strength indicator &mdash; that unfortunately had no alpha. <br><br>

                Since then, I&apos;ve been exploring the world of quantitative finance, trying to seek alpha.
