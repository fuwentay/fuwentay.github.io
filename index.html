                I'm Fu, studying Engineering Science @ Oxford. <br><br>
                Currently, I'm reading <a href="https://www.amazon.sg/Option-Volatility-Pricing-Strategies-Techniques/dp/0071818774">Option Volatility and Pricing</a> by Sheldon Natenburg.

                <h2>My journey</h2>
            </p>
            <p id="lineBreak">
                Since high school, I have always had a passion for mathematics and physics, regularly participating in Olympiads and various math and science-related workshops. <br><br>

                My interest was further ignited by participating in the Singapore Young Physicist Tournament, a scientific debate competition where students hypothesize explanations for phenomena, develop theoretical models, and validate them while defending against critiques from other teams. During my two iterations in the competition, I investigated problems such as the paradoxical sinking motion of bubbles in a column of oscillating fluid and the motion of a real Newton's cradle with Hertzian losses, among others. <br><br>

                This experience fostered a deep interest in research, leading me to aspire to become an applied researcher at the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), where I eventually interned for almost two years. During my internship, I contributed to the development of a smart mattress designed to alleviate pressure ulcer formation, which has since been patented by the agency. <br><br>

                However, through various hardware and firmware internships, I discovered a preference for software-related projects where I could construct the "brain" of the system. <br><br>

                During the Covid-19 pandemic, the accessibility of information on investing and trading increased significantly, with a surge of trading gurus and financial advisors online. This inspired me to create my first expert advisor on MetaTrader4 using moving average crossovers and the relative strength indicator, although it did not yield any alpha. <br><br>

                Since then, I've been exploring new strategies and learning about the various financial instruments available in the markets.
