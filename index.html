                Currently, I'm reading <a href="https://www.amazon.sg/Option-Volatility-Pricing-Strategies-Techniques/dp/0071818774">Option Volatility and Pricing</a> by Sheldon Natenburg.

                <h2 class="custom-h2">My journey</h2>
            </p>
            <p id="lineBreak">
                Since high school, I have always had a passion for mathematics and physics. <br><br>

                This interest was further developed in a scientific debate competition where students hypothesise explanations for phenomena, develop theoretical models, and validate them while defending against critiques from other teams. There, I investigated problems such as the paradoxical sinking motion of bubbles in a column of oscillating fluid and the motion of a real Newton's cradle with Hertzian losses, among others. <br><br>

                That experience fostered a deep interest in research, leading me to intern at a local R&D statutory board for almost two years. During my internship, I designed and built a smart mattress designed to alleviate pressure ulcer formation, which has since been patented by the agency. <br><br>

                However, through various hardware and firmware internships, I discovered a preference for software-related projects where I could construct the "brain" of the system, leading me to take on some software engineering roles. <br><br>

                My growing fascination with problem-solving and modelling systems eventually drew me toward the world of finance, where I have been exploring new strategies and learning about the various financial instruments available in the markets.
