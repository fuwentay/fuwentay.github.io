        <p>
            A few days ago, a post surfaced on Reddit claiming that a single whale was responsible for 
            crashing the price of $HYPE. Intrigued, I decided to take a closer look at 
            what supposedly happened and whether the strategy made any sense from a profitability standpoint.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the time, $HYPE was trading between $22–25 USD (7 Feb 2025). According to the post, 
            the whale held 265,000 $HYPE and executed the following trades on 7 Feb at 2pm UTC:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Opened a <strong>short position</strong> of 50,000 $HYPE @ $24.87</li>
            <li>Launched a <strong>20-minute TWAP sell</strong> of 20,000 $HYPE @ $5.52</li>
            <li>Launched a <strong>30-minute TWAP sell</strong> of 60,000 $HYPE @ $18.70</li>
            <li><strong>Closed the short</strong> @ $22.37 and cancelled remaining TWAP orders</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            The theory is that by placing a TWAP sell order at an extreme discount of $5.52, 
            the whale spooked the market. Traders, anticipating further drops, adjusted their bids downward. 
            With the TWAP steadily selling into the order book, this pressure pushed the price down to $22.37, 
            where the whale allegedly covered the short position. Importantly, the TWAP orders were cancelled 
            before the entire 80,000 $HYPE block was sold.
        </p>

        <h3>Crunching the Numbers</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Profit from short: (24.87 − 22.37) × 50,000 = $125,000</li>
            <li>Loss from 20min TWAP (if fully executed): (24.87 − 5.52) × 20,000 = $387,000</li>
            <li>Loss from 30min TWAP (if fully executed): (24.87 − 18.70) × 60,000 = $370,200</li>
            <li>Net loss (assuming full execution): $387,000 + $370,200 − $125,000 = $632,200</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            On paper, this doesn’t look like a winning strategy. Even if only part of the TWAP executed, 
            the whale still appears to have taken on outsized losses compared to the shorting gains.
        </p>

        <h3>Was There a Hidden Angle?</h3>

        <p>
            There are a few ways this could still have been profitable:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Partial fills:</strong> If only a small fraction of the low-priced TWAP orders actually filled, 
                the losses shrink dramatically while still creating the psychological effect of heavy selling.</li>
            <li><strong>Coordinated shorts:</strong> Other whales may have joined in, amplifying downside momentum and making 
                it easier to cover shorts profitably.</li>
            <li><strong>Optics over execution:</strong> The $5.52 TWAP may have been more about scaring the market than actually selling 
                at that level, leveraging panic to push prices down.</li>
            <li><strong>Wash trading:</strong> In theory, the whale could have been trading with themselves across different accounts, 
                faking sell pressure without actually losing those tokens.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            But if we take the trade log at face value, and assume the TWAPs executed fully, the strategy would have been a 
            major flop — with losses exceeding $600k. To break even, the whale would have needed to short 
            over 300,000 $HYPE, which is unrealistic to unwind without pumping the price back up.
        </p>

        <h3>My Take</h3>
        <p>
            The more likely scenario is that only a small portion of the low-priced TWAP actually went through. 
            If so, the whale’s losses were limited, while the market impact was significant enough to make the 
            50k short profitable. In other words: the TWAP wasn’t a genuine liquidation strategy, but a psychological 
            weapon to distort the order book. 
        </p>

        <p>
            What looked like a disaster was more likely a profitable manipulation.
