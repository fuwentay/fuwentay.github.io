        <p>
            A couple of days ago, a friend of mine shared with me a post on how a Whale dumped the price of $HYPE.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reading through it, I had an idea of how their strategy worked, but I also had my doubts. Here is
            some background information and how it supposedly went down:
        </p>
        <p>
            The Whale held 265,000 $HYPE, each of which traded between $22-25 USD on 7 Feb 2025. The following went down on 7 Feb @ 2pm UTC:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Shorted 50,000 $HYPE @ 24.87 USD</li>
            <li>20min TWAP sell 20,000 $HYPE @ 5.52 USD</li>
            <li>30min TWAP sell 60,000 $HYPE @ 18.70 USD</li>
            <li>Closed short position @ 22.37 USD and cancelled TWAP sell orders</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The hypothesis is that by placing a TWAP sell order at a low price of 5.52 USD (78% discount), it caused the order book to adjust with traders
            placing lower buy orders in anticipation of further price drops. This is further exacerbated given that it is a TWAP which by nature 
            continuously sells over a prolonged period of time. Once the price dropped to 22.37 USD, it is believed that the Whale bought back $HYPE
            to cover their short position. At the same time, the TWAP orders were cancelled before all 80,000 $HYPE were sold.
        </p>
        <p>
            Crunching through some numbers:
        </p>
        <!-- <li>
            Day's profits from shorting: $${(24.87-22.37) \times 50000 = 125000}$$
        </li>
        <li>
            Day's losses from 20min TWAP sell (assuming all sold): $${(24.87-5.52) \times 20000 = 387000}$$
        </li>
        <li>
            Day's losses from 30min TWAP sell (assuming all sold): $${(24.87-18.70) \times 60000 = 370200}$$
        </li>
        <li>
            Day's NET losses: $$ {387000 + 370200 - 125000 = 632200} $$
        </li> -->
        <li>
            Day's profits from shorting: (24.87-22.37) x 50000 = 125000 USD
        </li>
        <li>
            Day's losses from 20min TWAP sell (assuming all sold): (24.87-5.52) x 20000 = 387000 USD
        </li>
        <li>
            Day's losses from 30min TWAP sell (assuming all sold): (24.87-18.70) x 60000 = 370200 USD
        </li>
        <li>
            Day's NET losses: 387000 + 370200 - 125000 = 632200 USD
        </li>
        <p>
            Even if the Whale did not sell all the $HYPE through TWAP, it is clear that it is hard for the profits to outweigh the losses.
        </p>
        <p>
            As such, the only way I can imagine this strategy to be profitable is if there were other whales shorting $HYPE as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Suppose the entire TWAP order was filled, the losses would be $757200 USD. In order to make up for the losses, 302880 $HYPE would have to be shorted
            @ 24.87 to break even. However, the sheer volume of this would make it a difficult task to cover his short @ 22.37 because the buy-back would most certainly
            pump the coin.
        </p>

            Was this a flop? What are your thoughts?
